## Research Methods in Computer Science

This repository contains the material I have used for a 2 hour bootcamp on research methods in CS. I have conducted this session twice (August 2018 at IIT Gandhinagar and July 2017 at IIIT Delhi). Here is the [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoCoplWgvp4
) for the IIT Gandhinagar instantiation.


### Contents

I took four exercise and example driven sessions on:

1. Writing better emails: I took an example driven approach of writing good emails. I showed some poor and some good emails that I have written. We discussed a few fundamental characteristics of a good email. We did three hands-on exercise for writing e-mail to: i) potential advisor, ii) reporting results to advisor, iii) seeking help on a research project from someone outside the institute.

2. Towards better paper abstracts: I discussed the general structuring of research papers. We took case study on the constitution of a good paper abstract. We looked at potential scientific flaws that can be seen from the abstract itself. We did a few hands-on exercises. 

3. Thinking like a scientist: This session was a continuation of the previous one. We discussed the scientific method with the help of a trivial example. We did a few hands-on exercises where the students were asked to present hypothesis, observation,  and experimental design for few problems.

4. Debugging like a pro: This was also an example driven session. We looked at StackOverflow questions and understood the characteristics of good questions. These good questions have a much higher chance of being debugged correctly in quick time.

### Feedback

The average feedback was approximately 9/10. Some of the subjective comments are as follows:

>"The presentations were excellent. The hard work on making these slides was clearly visible. Also, the way the sessions were presented in the class was good."

>"Dr. Nipun Batra had given a good talk. I would like to thank him for giving his valuable time and for sharing lots of experiences which will help us a lot."

>"Relating with Real-World examples was the best part of the presentation."
